# ðŸš¢ Titanic Data Analysis

This repository contains **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the Titanic dataset using **NumPy** and **Pandas**.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate data cleaning, transformation, and analysis skills on a classic dataset.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

* Understand dataset structure (rows, columns, datatypes, missing values).
* Perform demographic analysis (age, gender, class).
* Calculate survival rates by class, gender, and family size.
* Create new features (e.g., `FamilySize`).
* Practice handling missing values with mean/mode imputation.
* Apply basic NumPy operations for descriptive statistics.

---

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

* **Python 3**
* **Pandas** â†’ data manipulation & analysis
* **NumPy** â†’ numerical operations

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset is taken from [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
It includes passenger information such as:

* Age, Sex, Passenger Class, Family Size
* Survival status (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)
* Fare, Embarkation port

## âœ… Key Learnings

* Handling missing values with mean/mode.
* Using `groupby()` for survival analysis.
* Creating new features like `FamilySize`.
* Comparing survival across gender and passenger class.
* Applying NumPy for mean, median, standard deviation, normalization.

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

* Extend EDA with statistical analysis.
* Visualize insights with Matplotlib/Seaborn.
* Build machine learning models for survival prediction.

ðŸ”— *This project is part of my learning journey in data science, starting with NumPy and Pandas before moving into Statistics, Probability, and Machine Learning.*
